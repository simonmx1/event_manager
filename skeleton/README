SKEL: Skeleton Project

This project provides a starting point for development of projects during the
courses "Software Architecture" and "Software Engineering". It is a
simple web application offering nearly no "real" functionality. Its main purpose
is to help you getting started quickly by providing a suitable starting point.

It utilizes Spring Boot and is configured as a Maven web application project with:
 - all relevant Spring Framework features enabled
 - embedded Tomcat with support for JSF2
 - embedded H2 in-memory database (including H2 console)
 - support for PrimeFaces
 - basic functionality for user management and Spring web security

Just execute  "mvn spring-boot:run" to start the skeleton project and connect to
http://localhost:8080/ to access the skeleton web application. You may login
with "admin" and "passwd".

Feel free to use this skeleton project as you see fit - but keept in mind that
this project is primarilly provided to be used for educational purposes. Don't
use it for production.
